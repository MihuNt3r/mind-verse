3. **Database Integration** - Direct database integrations where appropriate

## Integration Best Practices

- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Use circuit breakers for fault tolerance
- Monitor and log integration points
- Implement security at integration boundaries
- Consider rate limiting and throttling

Refer to the [System Integration](./SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md) document for detailed information about specific integration scenarios and implementations.
