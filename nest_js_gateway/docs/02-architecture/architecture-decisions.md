# Architecture Decisions

## ADR 1: Adoption of Clean Architecture

### Context

We needed to decide on an architectural pattern for the NestJS template that would provide clear separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability.

### Decision

We've adopted Clean Architecture, organizing the code into concentric layers:

1. **Core/Domain Layer** - Entities, value objects, repository interfaces, domain services
2. **Application Layer** - Commands, queries, DTOs
3. **Infrastructure Layer** - Repository implementations, external services
4. **Presentation Layer** - Controllers, guards, filters

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Clear boundaries between layers, domain logic is isolated from framework details
- **Positive**: Easier to test components in isolation
- **Positive**: More maintainable as the application grows
- **Negative**: More initial boilerplate code
- **Negative**: Steeper learning curve for developers new to the pattern

### Status

Adopted

## ADR 2: Implementation of CQRS Pattern

### Context

We needed a pattern to organize business logic for different operations in a structured way.

### Decision

We've implemented the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern, separating operations into:

- **Commands**: Operations that change state (e.g., RegisterUser, CreateRole)
- **Queries**: Operations that read state (e.g., GetUser, GetRoles)

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Clear separation between read and write operations
- **Positive**: Each operation has a single responsibility
- **Positive**: Easier to maintain and extend
- **Negative**: Adds some complexity to the codebase
- **Negative**: More files to manage

### Status

Adopted

## ADR 3: Selection of Prisma as ORM

### Context

We needed an ORM solution that would provide type safety, migrations, and a good developer experience.

### Decision

We've selected Prisma as the ORM for database access, using it through repository implementations that satisfy domain repository interfaces.

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Type-safe database access
- **Positive**: Migrations management
- **Positive**: Good developer experience with Prisma Client
- **Negative**: Another dependency to manage
- **Negative**: Some limitations compared to TypeORM for complex queries

### Status

Adopted

## ADR 4: JWT-based Authentication

### Context

We needed to decide on an authentication strategy that would be secure and scalable.

### Decision

We've implemented JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, providing:

- Short-lived access tokens
- Refresh token rotation for obtaining new access tokens
- Blacklisting capabilities for logout

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Stateless authentication with JWTs
- **Positive**: More secure with short-lived tokens and refresh token rotation
- **Positive**: Scalable across multiple instances
- **Negative**: More complex implementation than simple session-based auth
- **Negative**: Requires management of refresh tokens in the database

### Status

Adopted

## ADR 5: Role and Permission-based Authorization

### Context

We needed a flexible authorization system that would allow fine-grained access control.

### Decision

We've implemented a hybrid role and permission-based authorization system:

- Roles group permissions for easier management
- Permissions are defined as resource-action pairs
- Guards enforce permissions at the route level

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Flexible and fine-grained access control
- **Positive**: Easy to assign permissions through roles
- **Positive**: Declarative permission requirements with decorators
- **Negative**: More complex than simple role-based checks
- **Negative**: Performance overhead for permission checks

### Status

Adopted

## ADR 6: Comprehensive Error Handling Strategy

### Context

We needed a consistent approach to handling errors throughout the application.

### Decision

We've implemented a multi-layered error handling strategy:

- Domain exceptions for business rule violations
- Exception filters to convert exceptions to HTTP responses
- Logging interceptors to ensure all errors are logged

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Consistent error responses across the API
- **Positive**: Clear separation between domain and HTTP concerns
- **Positive**: Comprehensive error logging
- **Negative**: Requires disciplined use of exception types

### Status

Adopted

## ADR 7: Two-Factor Authentication Support

### Context

We needed to decide whether to include two-factor authentication in the template.

### Decision

We've implemented optional TOTP-based two-factor authentication:

- Users can enable/disable 2FA
- QR code generation for easy setup
- OTP verification during login

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Enhanced security option for users
- **Positive**: Industry-standard TOTP implementation
- **Negative**: More complex authentication flow
- **Negative**: Additional dependencies for OTP generation

### Status

Adopted

## ADR 8: Docker-based Development and Deployment

### Context

We needed a consistent environment for development and deployment.

### Decision

We've implemented Docker and Docker Compose configuration for the application:

- Docker Compose for local development
- Dockerfile for production builds

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Consistent environments across development and production
- **Positive**: Easy setup for new developers
- **Positive**: Simplified deployment process
- **Negative**: Learning curve for developers not familiar with Docker

### Status

Adopted

## ADR 9: Rate Limiting Implementation

### Context

We needed to protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage.

### Decision

We've implemented a flexible rate-limiting system:

- Configurable limits per endpoint
- Different strategies for different endpoints
- Decorator-based application

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Protection against abuse
- **Positive**: Flexible configuration
- **Positive**: Declarative usage with decorators
- **Negative**: Some performance overhead
- **Negative**: Potentially complex configuration for many endpoints

### Status

Adopted

These architecture decisions form the foundation of the NestJS template's design, providing a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture for building backend applications.
