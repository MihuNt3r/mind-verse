# Architecture Documentation

## Introduction

This section contains detailed documentation of the system architecture following the arc42 template structure. It provides a comprehensive view of the architectural decisions, components, and patterns used in the system.

## Documents in this Section

- [Introduction and Goals](./01-introduction-goals.md) - System requirements and driving forces
- [Constraints](./02-constraints.md) - Technical and organizational constraints
- [Context and Scope](./03-context-scope.md) - System boundaries and external interfaces
- [Solution Strategy](./04-solution-strategy.md) - Key architectural approaches
- [Building Block View](./05-building-blocks.md) - Decomposition of the system
- [Runtime View](./06-runtime-view.md) - Dynamic behavior of the system
- [Architecture Decisions](./architecture-decisions.md) - Key architecture decisions and their rationale

## Purpose

The architecture documentation provides a comprehensive view of the system design to help developers, architects, and other stakeholders understand how the system is structured, how it works, and why certain decisions were made.

Start with the [Introduction and Goals](./01-introduction-goals.md) for a high-level understanding, and then explore other sections as needed for more detailed information.
