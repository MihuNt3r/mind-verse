# Coding Standards

## Introduction

This document outlines the coding standards and guidelines for the project. Following these standards ensures code consistency, maintainability, and readability across the codebase.

## TypeScript and NestJS Guidelines

### General TypeScript Guidelines

  root((TypeScript\nGuidelines))
    Types
      Use explicit typing
      Prefer interfaces for objects
      Use enums for fixed values
      Use generics for reusable components
    Functions
      Clear function signatures
      Single responsibility
      Descriptive naming
      Default parameters
    Variables
      Descriptive naming
      Proper scoping
      Use const by default
      Avoid any type
    Error Handling
      Typed errors
      Centralized handling
      Proper propagation
```

### NestJS Specific Guidelines

- Follow the NestJS module organization pattern
- Use dependency injection for all dependencies
- Use NestJS decorators consistently
- Keep controllers thin, delegate business logic to services
- Use DTOs for data validation and transfer
- Use pipes for input validation
- Use proper exception filters for error handling

## Clean Architecture Implementation

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Responsibility | Examples |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Domain | Business entities and logic | Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services |
| Application | Use cases, workflow | Commands, Queries, DTOs |
| Infrastructure | Technical implementations | Repositories, External Services |
| Presentation | User interface | Controllers, Guards, Filters |

### File Organization

```
src/
├── application/
│   ├── commands/
│   ├── queries/
│   └── dtos/
├── core/
│   ├── entities/
│   ├── value-objects/
│   ├── repositories/
│   └── services/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── database/
│   ├── repositories/
│   └── services/
└── presentation/
    ├── controllers/
    ├── filters/
    ├── guards/
    └── modules/
```

## CQRS Implementation Guidelines

### Commands

- Commands should be named with verb-noun pattern (e.g., `CreateUserCommand`)
- Commands should have a single public `execute()` method
- Commands should perform a single operation
- Commands should not return domain entities directly

### Queries

- Queries should be named with get-noun pattern (e.g., `GetUserQuery`)
- Queries should have a single public `execute()` method
- Queries should be optimized for read operations
- Queries should return DTOs rather than domain entities

## Testing Standards

### Unit Tests

- Test each unit in isolation
- Mock all dependencies
- Focus on testing business logic and edge cases
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Integration Tests

- Test component interactions
- Test database interactions through repositories
- Test external service integrations

### E2E Tests

- Test complete API flows
- Test from the API consumer perspective
- Cover critical user journeys

## Code Quality Tools

### ESLint Configuration

The project uses ESLint with a custom configuration to enforce coding standards. The configuration includes:

- TypeScript-specific rules
- NestJS-specific rules
- Import order rules
- Formatting rules

### Prettier Configuration

Prettier is used for code formatting with the following key settings:

- Single quotes
- No semi-colons
- 2 space indentation
- 100 character line length

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single concern
- Include appropriate tests
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Ensure code meets all linting standards
- Include documentation updates where relevant
- Reference related issues or requirements

## Documentation Standards

- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs and interfaces
- Document complex algorithms and business rules
- Update relevant documentation when changing functionality
- Use clear, concise language

By following these standards, we ensure that our codebase remains maintainable, understandable, and of high quality as the project evolves.
