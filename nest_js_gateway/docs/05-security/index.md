# Security Documentation

## Introduction

This section provides comprehensive information about the security architecture, controls, and best practices implemented in the system.

## Documents in this Section

- [Security Architecture](./security-architecture.md) - Comprehensive security design documentation

## Security Overview

The application implements a defense-in-depth security strategy with multiple layers of security controls:

1. **Authentication** - JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, two-factor authentication, and email verification
2. **Authorization** - Role-based and permission-based access control
3. **Data Protection** - Encryption in transit and at rest, secure storage of sensitive data
4. **Input Validation** - Comprehensive validation of all inputs
5. **Rate Limiting** - Protection against brute force and denial of service attacks
6. **Security Headers** - HTTP security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities
7. **Audit Logging** - Logging of security-relevant events

## Security Best Practices

- Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions
- Keep dependencies updated to address security vulnerabilities
- Review security logs regularly for suspicious activity
- Perform regular security testing and code reviews
- Follow secure development practices

Refer to the [Security Architecture](./security-architecture.md) document for detailed information about the security controls and implementation.
