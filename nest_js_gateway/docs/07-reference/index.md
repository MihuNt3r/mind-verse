## Reference Information

The reference documents provide detailed information about specific technical aspects of the system:

1. **Domain Model** - Entities, value objects, and their relationships
2. **Error Handling** - How errors are handled throughout the system
3. **Logging** - Logging strategy and implementation
4. **Testing** - Testing approach and frameworks

The reference documentation is designed to be consulted as needed, rather than read from start to finish.
